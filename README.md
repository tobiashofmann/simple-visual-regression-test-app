# A simple visual regression test app

This is a sample app to show how visual regression testing can be used for testing web apps. More information about the app and the approach can be read at the following blog post: [Visual regression testing](https://www.itsfullofstars.de).

The recommended approach for the blog post and this app is to go through the steps described in the blog and to use this repository as a reference and help.

# Step 2: Configuration of UI tests

In this step [BackstopJS](https://github.com/garris/BackstopJS) is configured. The screen size for the tests is set to desktop and three pages of the app under test are added to the tests.

The UI tests are run in the next step.
