# A simple visual regression test app

This is a sample app to show how visual regression testing can be used for testing web apps. More information about the app and the approach can be read at the following blog post: [Visual regression testing](https://www.itsfullofstars.de).

The recommended approach for the blog post and this app is to go through the steps described in the blog and to use this repository as a reference and help.

# Step 1: Initialize project

In this step the project is initialzed (npm init) and [BackstopJS](https://github.com/garris/BackstopJS) is added.

The BackstopJS project is initialized via 

```sh
npx backstop init
```

This creates the directory structure and the sample backstop configuration file, including a sample UI test.
